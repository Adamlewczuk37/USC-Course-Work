This repository contains all of my past coursework at USC which used Github.

Starting with CS103: Intro to Programming, I learned how to code in C++ which included memory allocation, concepts in object-oriented programming, and basic data strucutres. This folder contains work from a few of the labs in the course and
some of the programming assignments that I had to complete. Bigint.cpp was the most complex project which involved using C++ vectors to perform arithmatic integer calculations on any sized number from base 2 to base 36.

The next course taken was CS104: Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming which served as an extension to the previous course. I learned in depth how to work with object-oriented programming and how to code recursive backtracking
algorithms. This folder contains all programming assignments for the course. Notable projects were programming a simplified backend to the Amazon website using object-oriented methods, an AVL tree with recursive updating functions, and 
HW5/6 which practiced finding backtracking algorithms for a variety of problems.

EE250: Distributed Systems for IoT is the final folder included in this repository which includes some of the early labs for the course. Future labs were done elsewhere on a class page on Github. These programs go over socket programming
and TCP/UDP protocols which were done in primarily Python. This course ended in a partner project which includes all of the material in the course. It is stored in another Github respository on my site.
