# CS103 - Intro to C++
This repository contains my projects and some extra assignments from CS 103 - Introduction to Programming at USC.
The first 7 files cover the 4 largest projects in the class, and the other files are from smaller assignments.
Bigint, bigint.h, and decipher all belong to the arbitrary precision arithmetic project, and maze/mazio both belong to the BFS maze solver project.
The other 2 main projects are connected-component labeling using BFS, and twenty-one which was coding blackjack.
All of the code is written in C++.
