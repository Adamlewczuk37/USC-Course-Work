## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: 
RESTful APIs are scalable because they rely on a server executing all of the get and send requests from clients. Because
everything is handled by the server, it can be scaled to many user just by increasing server resources.

Answer for Question 2: 
The resources that the mail server is providing are all of the text information of the mail, the inbox vs sent information of
the mail, and potentially the date and time information attached to each message.

Answer for Question 3: 
One method request that we did not use was PUT. We could implement this by allowing a user to potentially update an email 
message if they did not approve of what they originally sent.

Answer for Question 4: 
API keys are used to improve security of an online API by requiring additional user verification before use in order to
prevent unwanted attacks. This is especially handy in APIs storing private or monetary information such as bitcoin or a
banking application.
